* VueTorrent web ui added

# qBittorrent 
Heroku has set torrent reuploaders or URL reuploaders as a policy violating source code.Please use it at your own risk, your heroku account has a higher chance of being banned.

This web application downloads your torrent-files or magnet links or torrent http links and uploads directly to your any rclone drive instantly.
Here qBittorrent-nox (Linux) is used as web UI And Rclone is used as Uploader with the help of Docker.

Special thanks to rclone and qbittorrent-nox
